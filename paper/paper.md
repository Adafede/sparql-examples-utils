# Summary

Knowledegraphs are becoming more popular to share and explore scientitic and cultural data.
For public data the most common access method provided by the data providers are SPARQL endpoints.
SPARQL is a W3C standardized language to query graph data in using the RDF formalisms.
Such a query language is powerfull and allow for many options. 
Data providers have habitually provided a number of example SPARQL queries to inspire their users with what is possible.

# Statement of need

The SPARQL examples provided by many data providers have errors, no results or deviate slightly from the formal SPARQL 1.1. specification.
These examples are also provided in ad-hoc formats with limited expresivity and lack permanent identifiers.
Our tooling helps SPARQL query example providers maintain, visualize and test their examples.
